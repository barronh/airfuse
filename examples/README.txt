airfuse Example Gallery
=======================

This gallery houses examples on how to use airfuse to create maps of ozone and
fine particulate matter (FPM). This example uses NOAA's Air Quality Forecasting
Capability (NAQFC), AirNow monitors, and (for FPM) PurpleAir. The scripts
create NetCDF files, geojson files, and png files.

- NetCDF files are viewable in Panoply,
- geojson files are viewable in qGIS, ArcGIS, OpenLayers, leaflet,
- png files is viewable in leaflet as an overlay.
