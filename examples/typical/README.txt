Run Typical
-----------

Typical shows a typical set of scripts that could be paired with cronjobs to
create a working system with parallel CPU usage. The typical setup expects to
find .airnowkey and .purpleairkey files in the users home directory. They can
should have the keys necessary to interface with the purpleair api and the
AirNow api.
